A minimal working example of writting a collaborative paper
###########################################################

This repository (repo) is an illustrative example for the `reproducible research booklet <https://github.com/CRIStAL-PADR/reproducible-research-SE-notes>`_.

Imagine you are doing research and you wish write a paper or more simply a collaborative note with other people.

Since you are a researcher you hopefully use **LaTex**, don't you ?

In this project you will find:

- the basic *LaTex* setup for your collaborative project,
- tips to get an efficient workflow using GitHub, see for example:

	+ comments in commits
	+ `Issues <https://github.com/CRIStAL-Sigma/reproducible-paper/issues>`_

To start your own (public/private) collaboration you can either:

- create a new repo from scratch
- fork this repo to start with the minimal configuration
